# AI_wireless_2023

Competition Plan and Code based on transformer structure for the 2023 AI+ Wireless Competition on DataFountain.


main.py and ModelDesign.py are the code for the semi-final part.

main_preliminary_round.py and ModelDesign_preliminary_round.py are the code for the preliminary part.





Participants who did not train with mindspore in the semifinals should be ashamed. (just kidding, XD)
